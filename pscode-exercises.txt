// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input: Ask the user to enter a number
Process: Check if the number is divisible by 2
If number % 2 == 0, then the number is even
Else, the number is odd
Output: Print whether the number is even or odd

// Exercise 3:  

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
   - Initialize an empty list to store the numbers
   - For i from 1 to 5:
     - Prompt the user to enter a number
     - Read the number
     - Append the number to the list

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0
   - For each number in the list:
     - Add the number to `sum`
   - Calculate `average = sum / 5`

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
   - Initialize `min_number` to the first number in the list
   - Initialize `max_number` to the first number in the list
   - For each number in the list:
     - If the number is less than `min_number`, update `min_number`
     - If the number is greater than `max_number`, update `max_number`

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.
   - Print "The average is " followed by `average`
   - Print "The smallest number is " followed by `min_number`
   - Print "The largest number is " followed by `max_number`
